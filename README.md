# cantabria-landcover-timeseries
This multitemporal land cover dataset for the Cantabria region (northern Spain) has been generated using an algorithm developed in one of our projects and is organized into five land cover classes at a spatial resolution of 300 meters. The dataset is designed to support the analysis of land cover dynamics over time.
